## ðŸ”„ How It Works

### Local Data Storage
1. **Interview Completion**: When a user completes an interview, the results are automatically saved to local storage
2. **Skills Calculation**: Skills breakdown is calculated from the evaluation scores of each interview
3. **Streak Calculation**: Current streak is calculated based on consecutive days with interviews
4. **Performance Trends**: Performance data is extracted from the last 4 interviews for chart display

### Certificate Management
1. **Course Completion**: When a user completes a course assessment, the system updates the certificate management table
2. **Score Tracking**: Assessment scores are stored and used to determine if a certificate should be generated
3. **Certificate Generation**: If course is complete and assessment score â‰¥ 70%, a certificate is generated

### Data Persistence
- All interview data is stored in the browser's localStorage
- Data persists across browser sessions
- No dependency on external databases for core functionality
- Real-time updates without network requests

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Enhancements

### Glassy UI Elements
- **Cards**: Enhanced with backdrop blur and glass effects
- **Buttons**: Smooth hover animations with scale effects
- **Navigation**: Glassy navigation bar with blur effects
- **Animations**: Smooth fade-in, slide-up, and scale animations

### Color Scheme
- Maintained existing color scheme
- Added gradient text effects
- Enhanced contrast and readability
- Consistent glassy appearance throughout

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### To Complete the Implementation:

1. **Run Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   npx supabase login
   npx supabase link --project-ref ygcdksdsleyazlxfjpid
   npx supabase db push
   ```

2. **Test Local Storage**:
   - Add the TestLocalStorage component to a page temporarily
   - Run the test to verify functionality
   - Check browser console for results

3. **Verify Certificate System**:
   - Complete a course assessment
   - Check if certificate management table is updated
   - Verify certificate generation works
